# UCL Machine Learning MSc
This is an archive of lectures, resources, and coursework I submitted from my time at UCL.

## Who are you and what are you looking for?

### Students
If you're a current or prospective UCL student, this should cover a large fraction of the content:
* [Probabilistic and Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/victorfiz/ucl_ml/blob/main/unsupervised_learning/Probabilistic%20and%20Unsupervised%20Learning.pdf)
* [Approximate Inference](https://github.com/victorfiz/ucl_ml/blob/main/approximate_inference/Approximate_Inference.pdf)
* [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/victorfiz/ucl_ml/blob/main/supervised_learning/Supervised_Learning_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
* [Bayesian Deep Learning](https://github.com/victorfiz/ucl_ml/tree/main/bayesian_deep_learning/Bayesian%20Deep%20Learning)
* 

### ML Resource Scavengers
These stand out as being high-value documents in my educational journey:
* [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/victorfiz/ucl_ml/blob/main/reinforcement_learning/Learning_Guide_RL.pdf): a guide by Nishant Aklecha
* [LLM Visualisation](https://bbycroft.net/llm)

### Serious Stuff
If you're a professor or employer, this list of my submissions might be of interest:
* [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/victorfiz/ucl_ml/blob/main/supervised_learning/CW2_COMP0078/Supervised_Learning_CW2.pdf)
* [Probabilistic and Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/victorfiz/ucl_ml/blob/main/unsupervised_learning/CW1_COMP0086/Unsupervised_learning_CW1.pdf)
